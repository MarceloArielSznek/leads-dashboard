## 🐛 **BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Fixed: Conversational Text SQL Error**
**Problem:** AI was generating conversational responses instead of SQL queries, causing syntax errors when trying to execute "Sure, I can help..." as SQL.

**Solution:**
1. **Enhanced SQL Validation:** Added regex pattern matching to detect if response is actual SQL
2. **Special Keywords:** Implemented `CONVERSATIONAL_QUERY` and `UNABLE_TO_CREATE_SQL` keywords
3. **Graceful Fallback:** When AI returns conversational text, we now handle it properly instead of trying to execute it as SQL
4. **Better Error Handling:** Fixed variable scoping issues in error handling code

**Result:** No more SQL syntax errors, smooth conversational experience! 🎉
